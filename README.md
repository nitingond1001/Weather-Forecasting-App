### Technologies used

* **Kotlin**: Modern programming language for Android development known for concise and expressive syntax
  
* **Android SDK**: Software Development Kit that provides tools and APIs for building Android applications
  
* **MVVM architecture**: A design pattern that separates an app into three parts - Model, View, and ViewModel - making code more organized and maintaining a smooth user experience. It helps manage data, user interface, and business logic effectively
  
* **Shared Preferences**: Mechanism in Android for storing small amounts of data persistently, often used for app settings
  
* **ViewModel**: MVVM architecture component that holds UI-related data, surviving configuration changes, and lifecycle events
  
* **LiveData**: Architecture component that allows data observation for UI components, automatically updating when the underlying data changes
  
* **ViewBinding**: Library that generates binding classes for XML layouts, enabling direct interaction with views while improving type safety
  
* **Coroutines**: Kotlin library for managing asynchronous tasks more concisely and safely, simplifying multithreaded programming
  
* **Flows**: Kotlin reactive streams that handle asynchronous data streams with support for flow control and error handling
  
* **Retrofit**: Networking library for Android that simplifies HTTP requests and responses, often used for communicating with APIs
  
* **MPAndroidChart**: Powerful ibrary for creating various types of charts and graphs in Android applications
  
* **Glide**: Image loading library for efficient image loading and caching in Android apps
  
* **Algolia Search API Client**: Client library for integrating Algolia's search services into Android applications, enabling powerful search functionalities

* **Firebase Crashlytics**: A tool for real-time crash reporting that helps developers track and analyze app crashes.

* **Dagger Hilt**: A dependency injection framework for Android that simplifies dependency management and improves modularity, testability and maintainability of code.
